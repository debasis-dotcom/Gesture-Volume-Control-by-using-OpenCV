# Gesture-Volume-Control-by-using-OpenCV

## Description
This repository contains the Python code to develop your own hand gesture recognition system.

The app consists of 3 different modes:

Data Collection Mode: Allows the user to collect train, test, or validation data on a variety of hand gestures
Model Testing Mode: Test the model's ability to discern between different gestures through real-time visualizations
Music-Player/Gesture Mode: Use gestures to play music, pause music, and change the volume of music
I presented this app as my final project for a coding bootcamp I attended. The slide deck for my presentation has been included in the repository.

## Packages Used
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- NumPy

Here's a list of files in the directory:

src/demo.py: Contains all the functions to start and run the app
src/music: Contains the song that will be played during 'gesture mode'
Presentation (Gesture Jester): Contains the slide deck for my project presentation
Usage
